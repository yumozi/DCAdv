Starting code is forked from https://github.com/VICO-UoE/DatasetCondensation. The original repository includes codes for *Dataset Condensation with Gradient Matching* (ICLR 2021 Oral), *Dataset Condensation with Differentiable Siamese Augmentation* (ICML 2021) and *Dataset Condensation with Distribution Matching* (arXiv 2021).
